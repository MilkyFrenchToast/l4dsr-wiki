# Useful wiki features

This page will go over some of the main features you can use to format and present information in the wiki.

Feel free to reference from the official [Docusaurus Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) (link to the markdown features page) as well.

## Code

### Code block

````
```
balls
```
````
### Inline Code

```
`inline code`
```
(looks like this): `inline code`

## Admonitions

### How-to

To make an admonition, you do something like this:

```
:::note
Sample Text
:::
```

Which turns into this:

:::note
Sample Text
:::

### Standard Admonitions

:::note
:::

:::tip
:::

:::info
:::

:::caution
:::

:::danger
:::

### Custom ones for labeling strat difficulty (stolen from Titanfall 2 wiki xd)

:::diffe
this one is called `diffe`
:::

:::diffm
this one is called `diffm`
:::

:::diffh
this one is called `diffh`
:::

### Custom admonition title text

You can make these have custom titles instead of the default by putting words in brackets at the end:

```
:::info[COCK AND BALL TORTURE]
test
:::
```

:::info[COCK AND BALL TORTURE]
test
:::

### Nesting admonitions

Read [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions#nested-admonitions)

## Video Embeds

This is a two step thing:

At the top of the page you'll have to insert this (replace `YouTube` with `Twitch` if needed). You can also do `{YouTube, Twitch}` if you plan to embed videos from both sites on the same page.

```
import {YouTube} from 'mdx-embed'
```

After this, when you want to embed a YouTube or Twitch video, you write something like this (obviously replace the id with the one from your video of choice):

```
<YouTube youTubeId="ULYV5wadhNQ"/>
<Twitch twitchId="1980957789"/>
```

If you were to copy and paste the YouTube line, you'd get this: 
<YouTube youTubeId="ULYV5wadhNQ"/>

## Image Embeds

You can embed external images with normal markdown syntax:

```
![epic image](https://i.imgur.com/gjUlkjt.png)
```

However, it's preferred that we keep everything in the repository so that we don't have to worry about external files potentially getting deleted or becoming inaccessible for any reason.

This can be achieved by putting the image in the repo, ~~either in a central folder (let's say `assets`),~~ or in a subfolder of the current folder (named `img`). Both are arbitrary, dunno which is easier/better to work with overall. **For now we'll stick to subfolders named `img`**

Either way, you can then reference the image with a relative path. For example, if I put an image in a subfolder of the current folder where this markdown file resides (and the subfolder is named `img`), it would look like this:

```
![epic image](./img/TopGPeakAlphaSigmaMale.jpg)
```

Try to keep everything as `jpg` rather than `png`. Additionally, do not use `gif`, please use `webp` instead.
